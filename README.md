1. No I wouldnt use a unit test to test the message feature of a messaging application because it would have many components involved that interact with each other so it would be too complex and large. Unit tests are for testing individual parts of code.

2. Yes I would use a unit test to test the max message length feature of a messaging application because it can be isolated from other parts so testing individual parts of your code in encapsulated units would be possible. This would help check if this part of the code is functioning as it should.
